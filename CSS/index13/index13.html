    <p>When I was a child I liked cricket too but was never good at it. So I changed my hobby to football. Football was new to me in class 3. I did not play well in the beginning. But I liked the game very much. So I started practicing it. As a result, I began to play it well.</p>

    <p>In class 5 I became the captain of my class football team. At that time I was so much excited to become the captain. With time a learned a lot about football.</p>

    <p>In Football total 22 players play. Division of players is in two teams. Each team has 11 players. These players have to play with the ball only with legs. They have to kick the ball in the other teamsâ€™ goal post. Football is not like cricket. Weather is not an issue in football. Due to which players can play it the whole year.</p>
