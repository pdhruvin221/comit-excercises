    <p>Cricket is my favorite game. It is a very thrilling game. It is played between two teams consisting of 11 players in each team. There are many formats of cricket such as test match, one day match, and twenty-twenty match. Twenty-twenty is the most popular format. The team that makes more scores than the other wins.</p>

    <p>Cricket is the cult of all Indians. India is known for this game throughout the world. All age group Indians adore this game. One can find children, youngsters, and adults playing this game almost everywhere. In streets, on house roofs, empty plots, grounds, you will find children playing with improvised bat, wickets, and tennis ball.</p>

    <p>When Indian cricket team plays a match against any other team, the nation comes to a standstill. People leave their work and get glued to TV. If the match happens to be against Pakistan, the entire nation forgets everything except watching the match on TV. The day Indian cricket team wins against the arch-rivals, there is Diwali celebrations throughout the nation. People let off crackers at night to celebrate the victory.
